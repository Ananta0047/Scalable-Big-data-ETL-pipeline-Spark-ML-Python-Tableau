# Scalable-Big-data-ETL-pipeline-Spark-Python-AWS-Cloud
This project builds a scalable ETL pipeline using Apache Spark to extract and process data from semi-structured sources (e.g., news websites, APIs). Cleaned data is fed into a BERT-based model to classify fake news in near real-time, demonstrating the integration of Big Data and modern ML workflows.
